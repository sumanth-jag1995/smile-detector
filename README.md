# smile-detector
This is a simple opencv python project to detect the face, eyes and smile from the webcam

## Cascade Classifier
The Cascade classifier from the cv2 project uses the Haar xml files for face, eyes and smiles and then uses that to detect the face, eyes and smile respectively.

## Future scope
This can be used to detect emotions, recognise faces from a given database and so on.
